# DigitRecognizingApp
An application that lets you draw digits, and the recognizes them using machine learning. 
Was created while reading through the book of Michael Nielsen, link here:

The book is an amazing resource on the topic, and most of the inspiration came from there. Also, the "minst_loader.py" data loader was taken from Michael Nielsen's github repos.
